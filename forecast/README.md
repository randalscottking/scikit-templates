# Time Series Forecasting

This module demonstrates time series forecasting using Facebook's Prophet library.

## Overview

The implementation in `prophet_forecast.py` shows how to use Prophet for time series forecasting. Prophet is particularly effective for forecasting with:
- Strong seasonal effects
- Historical trends
- Missing data
- Shifts in the trend
- Outliers

## Features

- Automatic trend detection
- Seasonal component handling
- Holiday effects
- Outlier robust fitting

## Usage

1. Ensure Prophet is installed:
   ```bash
   pip install prophet
   ```

2. Prepare your time series data with:
   - A datetime column
   - A target variable column

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python prophet_forecast.py
   ```

## Components

Prophet decomposes time series into:
- Trend (g(t)): Long-term changes
- Seasonality (s(t)): Periodic changes
- Holiday effects (h(t)): Known events
- Error term (ε): Random variation

The forecast equation is:
y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + ε

## Best Practices

1. Use daily, weekly, or monthly data
2. Include several seasonal cycles in your training data
3. Mark known holidays or events
4. Remove outliers if they don't represent future events
